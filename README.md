# 3dof-robotic-arm
this code use joystick to control 3 dof robotic arm

basic code for controlling servos using the library servo.h
you can download the library here : https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo
to download the IDE : https://arduino.cc/
the compononent i use for this project is :
1. Arduino uno
2. set of bracket arm robot acrylic based
3. mini sg90 servos
4. Joystick
5. Breadboard mini
6. Jumper wire

Software :
1. Arduino IDE
2. Thinkercad ( for designing the robot )

be sure to place the servos at the right place
otherwise it will break the bracket for moving at the wrong direction 

this project is still not perfect, so the critic's still needed
and just for share education 

thanks

best regards
